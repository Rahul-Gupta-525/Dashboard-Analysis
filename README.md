## Features of the Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard includes the following visualizations:

1. **Filters**:

   - **Genre Filter**: Enables users to explore data for specific genres.
   - **Year Filter**: Allows filtering movies by release year.

2. **Key Metrics**:

   - Highest IMDb rating for the selected genre.
   - Highest Meta score for the selected genre.

3. **Visualizations**:

   - **Minimum Ratings Over the Years**: Shows how the lowest ratings have trended over time.
   - **Rating vs. Meta Score**: A scatter plot to analyze the correlation between IMDb ratings and Meta scores.
   - **Top 10 Movies**: Displays the highest-rated movies.
   - **Movies Released Over Time**: A line chart showing the number of movies released annually.
   - **Best Directors**: Highlights directors with the highest-rated movies.

## Steps to Reproduce

### 1. Data Scraping

The data was scraped using Python. The key steps include:

- Fetching movie details like name, rating, duration, release year, genre, director, and Meta score.
- Storing the data in a CSV file for further analysis.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing script (provided in the `preprocessing.ipynb` notebook) includes:

- Cleaning and transforming the data for consistency.
- Handling missing values and converting data types.

### 3. Dashboard Creation

- The cleaned data was imported into Power BI.
- Visualizations were created to address the problem statement.
- Filters and slicers were added to enhance interactivity.
